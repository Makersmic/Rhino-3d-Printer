# Cheeky Monkey-the filament box
An unfinished design, Cheeky Monkeys initial putpose was to provide monitoring and filament splices during 3d printing or other manufacturing procedures but was subsequently halted when the realization came that Cheeky Monkey needed to evolve into something much more in order to support future tool heads or manufacturing techniques.  
Cheeky Monkeys future goals will be to support 3d printing filament monitoring, an air handling system for high pressure blow air accessories and too heads, deep vacuum for chip removal and vacuum forming.
