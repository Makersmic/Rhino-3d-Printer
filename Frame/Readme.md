## The Frame
The Rhino utilizes aluminum extrusions based on the popular 2020, 2040, 2060 specification and 0.25" x 2" aluminum flat bar among other standard fasteners.  

### Designed for DIY
I took an uncommon approach with the aluminum flat bar components in the sense that you will find some components directly mounted to them.  To keep hole placement and 
other features accurate I have designed up 3d printable templates for hole placement and other features such as large pass-through cut-outs.  Templates can be simply clamped to the
workpiece and then a user may use a cordles drill or router for the appropriate feature.  When using a router, load a 0.375" flush trim bit with plenty of cutting fluid.  Tutorial videos 
may be found on youtube of several people utuilizing a router for cutting aluminum.  It is recommeneded to watch a couple if you are unfamiliar with this technique.
