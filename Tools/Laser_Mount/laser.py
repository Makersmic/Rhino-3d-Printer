# The Laser:
Current primary functions of the laser attachment are cutting of vector based shapes out of flat sheet material.  Rhino 
firmware has not been optimised for engraving of raster images.

Laser attachment functions through the available 12v supply.

Rhino has been optimised to work with Laserweb but is not limited by its usage allowing for other
Laser control software.
