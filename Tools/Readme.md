# Rhino-Tools
The Rhino Motion System utilizes tools mounted to a motion carriage.  Tools currently available are:
-the Jack Rabbit 3d printing tool head 
-Laser Engraving/Cutting tool head

Tools may be powered by either 12v or 24 pwm signal.

We strongly encourage others to develop tools for the Rhino Motion System.

Development underway for a mini-spindle and needle cutter tool heads!
