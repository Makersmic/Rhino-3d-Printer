## Apps:
I've been a long time user of Cura for 3d printing and thus far it has done the fine.  For laser cutting or rather gcode generation for laser cutting I use Laserweb,while at the same time using suite of other program to pull images/toolpathes from like autocad, illustrator, or adobe acrobat.  For the spindle I've only just dabbled a bit with usage, and that was with Fusion360.
For the longest time klipper did not support raster engraving, not sure if it does noe but if so, wiring for the laser will need tobe redo e to account for this, i think.
For a while i thought an all in one program would be best but most programs out there are too locked down for their own equipment not allowing a user to input custom machines.  Sucks, i would have really liked to find one.
