##XY Motion System
Optimized for 15mm belts, the files found within this section will enable you to construct the xy motion system.  

##Why 15mm belts?
Because the tools that can be used with the Rhino motion system we felt it best to go with some hefty belts.  Benefits of these larger belts would include better or less resonance 
on the gantry which translates to higher quality 3d prints, smoother cuts when using laser attachment or spindle attachment, and a quieter printer.

##How long should the belts be?
3 meters for each belt run, so 6 meters total will be needed.  It is also recommended to utilize dust-proof glass fiber core belts.
