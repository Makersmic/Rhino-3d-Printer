### XY Belt Tensioning System
Components that make up the belt tensioners for each belt.  Two Assemblies will need to be constructed to complete the motion system.  Optimized for 15mm 2gt belts, and pulleys with a total height of 19mm.  Refer to the included drawing for assembly and parts list.

## Tensioning Your Belts
Step 1. Loosen the belt clamps located on the x-carriage.

Step 2. Adjust both belt tensioners to their lowest setting.

Step 3. Adjust both belts through the x-carriage belt clamps as to where they are snug, while ensuring the gantry equally perpendicular on each y axis linear rail.  Use the through-holes of the linear rail for quick reference.  Do not worry about getting the belts super tight, just snug with zero slack.

Step 4. Tighten the belt clamps on the x-carriage.

Step 5. Using the tension knob of the belt tensioner to index into one of 5 tension setttings, adjust each tensioner to equal tension.  There are 5 possible settings for belt tension.

Done!
