First conceived as a 3d printer, Rhino has evolved into a multi-tool motion system platform.  With a focus on 2d and 3d manufacturing Rhino gives you the headroom to create some truely amazing projects.  

## Key features include:
- Swappable Toolhead with tools for 3d printing, laser engraving/cutting, and drag knife manufacturing
- All-Purpose Vacuum Bed
- 3-Point Z-Axis Leveling
- Enclosed Build Chamber
- Controlled with Klipper Firmware

## More to come...
While the main platform is complete on the Rhino Motion System there are still components that need to be completed.  These components are:
- Project 'Cheeky Monkey'-the filament box.  Total redesign to include the ability to have interchangeable modules.  These modules would include:
- Filament Monitoring
- Air Handling System
- Chip Exhaust
- Liquid Cooling
- Small Build Farm Management.

- Project 'Fresh Air'-an onboard air system for part cooling and air filtration.  Finalize design, find suitable filter material.
- Mini Spindle-Firmware, wiring, workflows.
