At long last the 15mm belt components are in the process of being uploaded along other updates to the Rhino Motion System.

Thanks for visiting this project of mine.  Please keep in mind this is a personal project, if you see something that needs fixed or could help in development please let me know!

First conceived as a 3d printer, Rhino has evolved into a multi-tool motion system platform.  With a focus on 2d and 3d manufacturing Rhino gives you the headroom to create some truely amazing projects.  

## Key features include:
- Swappable Toolhead
- Jack Rabbit, direct drive extruder
- Hot Joe, Mini Spindle
- Light Saber, Laser Module
- Ostrich, Drag Knife Module
- All-Purpose Vacuum Bed
- 3-Point Z-Axis Leveling
- Enclosed Build Chamber
- Fresh Air, utilized for 3d print part cooling, blow-air for laser cutting/engraving, and chip evacuation for the spindle module
- Controlled with Klipper Firmware

## More to come...
While the main platform is complete on the Rhino Motion System there are still components that need to be completed.  These components are:
- Project 'Cheeky Monkey'-the filament box.  Total redesign to include the ability to have interchangeable modules.  These modules would include:
- Filament Monitoring
- Air Handling System
- Chip Exhaust
- Liquid Cooling
- Small Build Farm Management.
