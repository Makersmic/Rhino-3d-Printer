The Rhino is a multi-tool motion system platform using a corexy belt path for the xy motion motion components.  With a focus on 2d and 3d manufacturing Rhino gives you the headroom to create some truely amazing projects.  

## Key features include:
- Swappable Toolhead
- 15mm belts on X & Y
- Jack Rabbit, direct drive extruder
- Hot Joe, Mini Spindle
- Light Saber, Laser Module
- Ostrich, Drag Knife Module
- 3-Point Z-Axis Leveling
- Enclosed Build Chamber
- Fresh Air, utilized for 3d print part cooling, blow-air for laser cutting/engraving, and chip evacuation for the spindle module
- Controlled with Klipper Firmware

## More to come...
While the main platform is complete on the Rhino Motion System there are still components that need to be completed.  These components are:
- Project 'Cheeky Monkey'-the filament box.  Total redesign to include the ability to have interchangeable modules.  These modules would include:
- Filament Monitoring
- Air Handling System
- Chip Exhaust
- Liquid Cooling
- Small Build Farm Management.

This is an ever evolving project that is highly expenadable.  Expect to see updates from time to time on items that I felt needed improvement or corrected.
