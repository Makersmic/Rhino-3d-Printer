## Service Bay
When i think about  a maintenance bay, a user may put a tool into said bay and the user be able to service a tool.  Functions that
a service bay would need to be facilitate all of the tools by default.  The bay would need meet all of the requirements that umbilical holds while also having the ability to test 
components such as endstops or other possible hardware.
