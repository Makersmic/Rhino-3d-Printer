The Rhino utilizes multiple heated silicon mats on a single aluminum heat spreader to ensure that heat is evenly distributed during the build process.  Unlike systems from other manufacturers the multiple heate mats are meant to work in unison but still retain the ability to be heated separately.  This is due to the range of build plate materials available and those materials having a tendancy to warp due to heat fluctuations.  Because of this we developed a simple macro to control the heaing sequence of all the beds. 

Note these variables will change for setup when altering this macro for your setup.
Heater_Bed0........Left Heater Mat
Heater_Bed2........Right Heater Mat
Heater_Bed.........Default Heater Bed Parameter

Place in start gcode after heated temp has been set!

[gcode_macro BEDMIMIC]
gcode:
  SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=Heater_Bed2 TARGET={printer.heater_bed.target}
  SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=Heater_Bed0 TARGET={printer.heater_bed.target}
