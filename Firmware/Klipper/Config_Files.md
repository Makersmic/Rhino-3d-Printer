For now iahve found that i can keep all of the macros for the various printer.cfg files in one file and it not be a problem.  The only conflict arises when i try to envokde a macro that calls upon a function of a different tool.  It may not always throw an error but on some of them it does.

Moving forward i'd like to seperate out the pin configurations into a seperate file.

Currently using Fluidd web interface v0.9.1-609-gf2b4d353 so it's a little dated.  Need to try and migrate over to mainsail since it is supported right now.

Would be nice if someone developed a printer.cfg swapper program.
