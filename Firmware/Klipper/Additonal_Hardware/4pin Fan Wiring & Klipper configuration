As there are a few examples floating around the internet i found this guide helpful in configuring the 4 pin fan used for the part cooling solution of the Rhino.

The tutorial below illustrates an example for a 4 pin fan, but this same method may be used for 5 pin fans.  Check your fan for appropriate pinout information prior!
