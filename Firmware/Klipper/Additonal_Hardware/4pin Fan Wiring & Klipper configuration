As there are a few examples floating around the internet i found this guide helpful in configuring the 4 pin fan used for the part cooling solution of the Rhino.

The tutorial below illustrates an example for a 4 pin fan, but this same method may be used for 5 pin fans.  This is especially useful for driving delta fans, ensure your mosfet is rated for the current draw of the delta fan.  Delta fans typically draw more amperage than normal case fans.  Check your fan for appropriate pinout information prior!
